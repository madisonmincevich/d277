      <p class="overview">
        Raleigh is North Carolina's state capitol. According to
        Citytowninfo.com, "Due to the prevalence of oak trees in the area, the
        city is widely known as the "City of Oaks." Its population of 27,000
        makes it the second largest city in North Carolina, after Charlotte.
        Raleigh is part of The Triangle, which also includes Durham, and Chapel
        Hill. The Triangle is named for the Research Triangle Park, created in
        1959, that is located between Durham and Raleigh. Raleigh is also one of
        the fastest growing cities in the United States." (<a

        According to Britannica.com, "The site was selected in 1788, and the
        city was laid off from a tract of forest in 1792, soon after the
        American Revolution, when North Carolina, like several other original
        states, moved its capital westward from the seaboard. Originally called
        Wake Courthouse, the city was renamed for Sir Walter Raleigh. The first
        capitol, completed in 1794, burned in 1831 and was replaced by the
        present building, completed in 1840. It stands in the middle of a large
        square and is considered an outstanding example of Greek Revival
        architecture. Capitol Square is surrounded by various state and historic
        buildings and churches. During the American Civil War, Raleigh served as
        a Confederate headquarters until April 13, 1865, when Union troops under
        William Tecumseh Sherman occupied the city without encountering
        resistance. Raleigh is a major point for retail shipping and wholesale
        distribution for eastern North Carolina. After World War II the city
        attracted numerous factories manufacturing a wide variety of products,
        now including communications equipment, electronic equipment, computers,
        and processed foods. In addition, Raleigh is a research and development
        centre for textiles and chemicals. Services are also important, and a
        number of insurance companies have their home offices or regional
        headquarters there. The city is an educational centre and the site of
        North Carolina State University (1887; part of the University of North
        Carolina system), Shaw University (1865), and Meredith (1891), St.
        Augustine’s (1896), and Peace (1857) colleges. The city is part of North
        Carolina’s Research Triangle, a three-county area of cultural,
        scientific, and educational activities that includes Research Triangle
        Park to the northwest. The North Carolina Museum of Art is also in
        Raleigh, as are the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina
        Museum of Natural Science, and Mordecai Historic Park. Many historic
        buildings have been preserved, including the Joel Lane House (c. 1760;
        the oldest building in Raleigh) and the home in which Andrew Johnson,
        17th president of the United States, was born in 1808 (now a historic
        site). Nearby recreational facilities include William B. Ulmstead State
        Park (northwest) and Clemmons Educational State Forest (southeast). Inc.
        1795. Pop. (2010) 403,892; Raleigh-Cary Metro Area, 1,130,490; (2020)
        467,665; Raleigh-Cary Metro Area, 1,413,982." (<a

          According to Visitraleigh.com, "At night, Raleigh, N.C., buzzes with
          activity. Only a destination with the big-city energy yet small-town
          approachability of Raleigh can act as such a welcoming place to spend
          a night on the town sipping cocktails, dancing to some live music, or
          discovering a modern-meets-historic, local beer bar that residents
          aren't worried about keeping secret." (<a
